# Extending Standard Conditions

No matter how configurable the standard conditions may be, there are still going to be times when you need to do something custom for your application.

We've put a great amount of effort into giving you as many places to modify the behavior of the standard conditions.

> Psst... You can also create your own [custom condition](/condition-types/custom) entirely from scratch.
