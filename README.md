Short description and motivation.

## Usage
How to use my plugin.

## Bullet Train Installation
1. Add ruby gem 
```
source "https://yourAPIKey@gem.fury.io/hammerstonedev" do
  gem "refine-rails"
end
```

2. Add front end packages via yarn (see yarn instructions) 
### TO FIX 
3. Add Hammerstone routes (these should be in the gem) 
### TO FIX
4. Add `_loading` partial 

### TO FIX
5. Add helper file (why isn't this coming through in the gem)?

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "refine-rails"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
